My solution for the provided Technical Task.

There is more I would have liked to complete with the task, 
however any major additions would require plenty of time to research solutions and implement them, 
so I have opted to leave these for now in the spirit of "Please do not feel that you need to spend more than a couple of hours working on the provided tasks."

The only external package used is NuGet "Newtonsoft.Json".
If it is not already included when cloning the repo:
  Inside Visual Studio, go to [Project > Manage NuGet Packages... ] then search for and add the package.

Press the start button and the Form should appear on screen,
Upload one of the JSONs from the sample data
